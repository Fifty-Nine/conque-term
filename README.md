conque-term
===========

This is a fork of conque-term, originally available at http://code.google.com/p/conque/. Conque-term lets you run a shell inside vim, which is awesome.
It does, however, have a few annoying bugs. This version fixes some of them.

Conque-term is available under the MIT/Expat license. (http://directory.fsf.org/wiki/License:Expat)
